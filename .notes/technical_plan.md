## Technical Considerations

1. **Performance**

   - Model size < 500MB (free tier limit)
   - API response time < 1s
   - Efficient resource usage

2. **Scalability**

   - Async processing
   - Proper caching
   - Resource monitoring

3. **Maintainability**
   - [x] Type hints everywhere
   - [ ] Comprehensive tests
   - [x] Clear documentation
   - [x] Modern code practices

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. Create Colab training notebook
2. Implement inference optimization
3. Add unit tests
4. Start web application development
